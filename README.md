# Automated-Digging-Machinery
The aim of the project is to create a digging machinery for soil and stream sediment sampling
This project is going to involve the integration of knowledge and applications from hydraulics ,
electrical and electronics engineering, programming and AI.
Currently , the soil sampling is done with people having to manually go into the the exploration zones ,
they then have to dig between 0.4m to 0.6m below ground surface in order to take proper samples. 
What  this project seeks to address is to remove the manual aspect of digging with an intelligent robotic device. 
By replacing the humans , we  hope to create a cost effective and reliable system.
